## 2024-05-24 - Sensitive Data in Decoding Error Logs
**Vulnerability:** The application was logging the entire raw response body when a JSON decoding error occurred in `APIClient.swift`. This could expose PII, authentication tokens, or financial data if the API returned a malformed but sensitive response (or a successful response that the client failed to parse).
**Learning:** Developers often add full body logging to debug "why" decoding failed (e.g., to see the field mismatch), but this practice violates security principles by persisting sensitive data into system logs which might be accessible to other apps or crash reporters.
**Prevention:** Use targeted logging that describes *where* the error occurred (endpoint) and *what* the error was (type mismatch) without dumping the *data* itself. If full body debugging is needed, it must be wrapped in `#if DEBUG` and ideally sanitized, but even then it's risky.
